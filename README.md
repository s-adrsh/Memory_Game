# Memory Game

## Description

This is a classic memory game built with React. The game tests player's memory skills by challenging them to match pairs of cards.

## How to Play

The game starts with all cards face down. Click on a card to flip it over and reveal its emoji. Then click on a second card to try to find a matching emoji. If the two cards match, they will remain face up. If not, they will flip back over. The goal of the game is to match all pairs of cards.
